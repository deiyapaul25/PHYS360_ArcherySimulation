# PHYS360_BungeeJumping
Physics 360 Final Project - Simulation and Animation of Bungee Jumping 

Title: Bungee Jumping Simulation
Summary: This project aims to simulate and animate the act of bungee jumping while highlighting the physics/kinematics behind the process. This is executed using Python and its relevant packages such as NumPy, MatPlotLib, and more. 
Background: Bungee jumping is an oscillary motion and serves as a great application of methods covered in class such as using ordinary differential equations to solve and simulate oscillations such as the double pendulum. It also incorporates methods of animation covered in class as well. This is an interesting project as it combines a fun activity such as 
Resources: Not applicable at the moment
Objectives: Outline the kinematics and math behind bungee jumping using computational physics methods.
